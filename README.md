This finds the Steam App ID of the game you enter then converts it into Lua & Manifest files you can use for SteamTools.

Still in development so bugs are expected! (Report issues to the github)

When typing the game name, try enter it as best as you can.

Even if you spell it a bit wrong, it can still auto find the game you were trying to spell.

Just run the exe and boom!
